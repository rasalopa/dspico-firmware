#ifdef ENABLE_STATUS_LEDS

// Bumped once every time an SD transfer actually starts, from SdCard's state
// machine (StateReadBegin / StateWriteBegin), which every transfer passes
// through: the interrupt driven ones and the blocking ones alike. An r4 mode rom
// read or a FatFs write begins AND finishes inside one main loop pass, so
// sampling the card state from that loop would never see it; counting at the
// source does.
//
// Where the count happens matters for a reason that is not obvious: the card
// command handlers are __scratch_y, and SCRATCH_Y is also where the core 0
// stack lives, growing down onto the top of that code with only a few hundred
// bytes to spare. Every byte this feature puts into those handlers - an inlined
// increment, a call and its long-branch veneer - comes straight out of that
// margin, and the top of the bank is exactly where the veneers into the USB
// code sit. So nothing here is called from a __scratch_y function, and the
// build must leave __scratch_y_end__ where upstream has it.
//
// An increment can in principle be lost if two contexts race here. The cost of
// that is one missed blink, which is not worth an interrupt disable.
